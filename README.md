## When played a temporary 'AmbientSound' is spawned that follows the Token

Both GMs and players can play these sounds but players will require an active GM to be present.

## Player Permissions

Players can create and edit sounds on their tokens if editing is toggled on by the GM by Right-clicking the Token HUD button
